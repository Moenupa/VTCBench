Like locoism for livestocks, Large Language Models (LLMs) can suffer from ingestion of large amounts of context. LoCoxim (**Lo**ng-**Co**nte**X**t via **Im**ages, lo-co-sim) aims to propose an alternative to LLM memory by converting context to images and leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for improved understanding and generation.
